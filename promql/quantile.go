// bucketQuantile calculates the quantile 'q' based on the given buckets. The

// needed before calling this function). The quantile value is interpolated
// assuming a linear distribution within a bucket. However, if the quantile
// falls into the highest bucket, the upper bound of the 2nd highest bucket is
// returned. A natural lower bound of 0 is assumed if the upper bound of the
// lowest bucket is greater 0. In that case, interpolation in the lowest bucket
// happens linearly between 0 and the upper bound of the lowest bucket.
// However, if the lowest bucket has an upper bound less or equal 0, this upper
// bound is returned if the quantile falls into the lowest bucket.
//

// happening during evaluations of AST functions, we should report those

// The assumption that bucket counts increase monotonically with increasing
// upperBound may be violated during:
//
//   * Recording rule evaluation of histogram_quantile, especially when rate()
//      has been applied to the underlying bucket timeseries.
//   * Evaluation of histogram_quantile computed over federated bucket
//      timeseries, especially when rate() has been applied.
//
// This is because scraped data is not made available to rule evaluation or
// federation atomically, so some buckets are computed with data from the
// most recent scrapes, but the other buckets are missing data from the most
// recent scrape.
//
// Monotonicity is usually guaranteed because if a bucket with upper bound
// u1 has count c1, then any bucket with a higher upper bound u > u1 must
// have counted all c1 observations and perhaps more, so that c  >= c1.
//
// Randomly interspersed partial sampling breaks that guarantee, and rate()
// exacerbates it. Specifically, suppose bucket le=1000 has a count of 10 from
// 4 samples but the bucket with le=2000 has a count of 7 from 3 samples. The
// monotonicity is broken. It is exacerbated by rate() because under normal
// operation, cumulative counting of buckets will cause the bucket counts to
// diverge such that small differences from missing samples are not a problem.
// rate() removes this divergence.)
//
// bucketQuantile depends on that monotonicity to do a binary search for the
// bucket with the Ï†-quantile count, so breaking the monotonicity
// guarantee causes bucketQuantile() to return undefined (nonsense) results.
//
// As a somewhat hacky solution until ingestion is atomic per scrape, we
// calculate the "envelope" of the histogram buckets, essentially removing
// any decreases in the count between successive buckets.
