Prometheus supports basic authentication and TLS.
This is **experimental** and might change in the future.

To specify which web configuration file to load, use the `--web.config.file` flag.

The file is written in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML),
defined by the scheme described below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

The file is read upon every http request, such as any change in the
configuration and the certificates is picked up immediately.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows:

* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
* `<filename>`: a valid path in the current working directory
* `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password
* `<string>`: a regular string

A valid example file can be found [here](/documentation/examples/web-config.yml).

```yaml
tls_server_config:
  # Certificate and key files for server to use to authenticate to client.
  cert_file: <filename>
  key_file: <filename>

  # Server policy for client authentication. Maps to ClientAuth Policies.
  # For more detail on clientAuth options:
  # https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#ClientAuthType
  #
  # NOTE: If you want to enable client authentication, you need to use
  # RequireAndVerifyClientCert. Other values are insecure.

  # CA certificate for client certificate authentication to the server.
  [ client_ca_file: <filename> ]

  # Verify that the client certificate has a Subject Alternate Name (SAN)
  # which is an exact match to an entry in this list, else terminate the
  # connection. SAN match can be one or multiple of the following: DNS,
  # IP, e-mail, or URI address from https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509#Certificate.

  [ cipher_suites:

  # prefer_server_cipher_suites controls whether the server selects the
  # client's most preferred ciphersuite, or the server's most preferred
  # ciphersuite. If true then the server's preference, as expressed in
  # the order of elements in cipher_suites, is used.
  [ prefer_server_cipher_suites: <boolean> | default = true ]

  # order. Available curves are documented in the go documentation:
