# HTTPS and authentication

Prometheus supports basic authentication and TLS.
This is **experimental** and might change in the future.

To specify which web configuration file to load, use the `--web.config.file` flag.

The file is written in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML),
defined by the scheme described below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

The file is read upon every http request, such as any change in the
configuration and the certificates is picked up immediately.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows:

* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
* `<filename>`: a valid path in the current working directory
* `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password
* `<string>`: a regular string

A valid example file can be found [here](/documentation/examples/web-config.yml).
