# Disabled Features

Here is a list of features that are disabled by default since they are breaking changes or are considered experimental.
Their behaviour can change in future releases which will be communicated via the [release changelog](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

You can enable them using the `--enable-feature` flag with a comma separated list of features.
They may be enabled by default in future versions.

## `@` Modifier in PromQL

`--enable-feature=promql-at-modifier`

The `@` modifier lets you specify the evaluation time for instant vector selectors,
range vector selectors, and subqueries. More details can be found [here](querying/basics.md#modifier).

##Â Remote Write Receiver

`--enable-feature=remote-write-receiver`

The remote write receiver allows Prometheus to accept remote write requests from other Prometheus servers. More details can be found [here](storage.md#overview).
