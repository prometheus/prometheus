Prometheus, a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed
to be true.

Prometheus's main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring systems are:

- a **multi-dimensional** data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
- PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
- no dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
- timeseries collection happens via a **pull model** over HTTP
- **pushing timeseries** is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
- multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
- support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**

## Install

There are various ways of installing Prometheus.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)
on [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Prometheus.
See the [Installing](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/)
chapter in the documentation for all the details.

Debian packages [are available](https://packages.debian.org/sid/net/prometheus).

### Docker images

Docker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).

You can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with

    $ docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus

Prometheus will now be reachable at http://localhost:9090/.

### Building from source

To build Prometheus from the source code yourself you need to have a working
Go environment with [version 1.13 or greater installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
You will also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
installed in order to build the frontend assets.

You can directly use the `go` tool to download and install the `prometheus`
and `promtool` binaries into your `GOPATH`:

    $ go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
    $ prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml

*However*, when using `go get` to build Prometheus, Prometheus will expect to be able to
read its web assets from local filesystem directories under `web/ui/static` and
`web/ui/templates`. In order for these assets to be found, you will have to run Prometheus
from the root of the cloned repository. Note also that these directories do not include the
new experimental React UI unless it has been built explicitly using `make assets` or `make build`.

An example of the above configuration file can be found [here.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)

You can also clone the repository yourself and build using `make build`, which will compile in
the web assets so that Prometheus can be run from anywhere:

    $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
    $ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git
    $ cd prometheus
    $ make build
    $ ./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml

The Makefile provides several targets:

  * *build*: build the `prometheus` and `promtool` binaries (includes building and compiling in web assets)
  * *test*: run the tests
  * *test-short*: run the short tests
  * *format*: format the source code
  * *vet*: check the source code for common errors
  * *docker*: build a docker container for the current `HEAD`

## React UI Development

For more information on building, running, and developing on the new React-based UI, see the React app's [README.md](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/web/ui/react-app/README.md).

## More information

  * The source code is periodically indexed: [Prometheus Core](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/prometheus).
  * You will find a CircleCI configuration in `.circleci/config.yml`.
  * See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.
