A fast Golang queue using a ring-buffer, based on the version suggested by Dariusz GÃ³recki.
Using this instead of other, simpler, queue implementations (slice+append or linked list) provides
substantial memory and time benefits, and fewer GC pauses.

The queue implemented here is as fast as it is in part because it is *not* thread-safe.

Follows semantic versioning using https://gopkg.in/ - import from
[`gopkg.in/eapache/queue.v1`](https://gopkg.in/eapache/queue.v1)
for guaranteed API stability.
