<!--
    Don't forget!
    
    - If the PR adds or changes a behaviour or fixes a bug of an exported API it would need a unit/e2e test.
    
    - Where possible use only exported APIs for tests to simplify the review and make it as close as possible to an actual library usage.
    
    - No tests are needed for internal implementation changes.
    
    - Performance improvements would need a benchmark test to prove it.
    
    - All exposed objects should have a comment.
    
    - All comments should start with a capital letter and end with a full stop.
