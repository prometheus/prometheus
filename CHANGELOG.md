# Changelog

## 2.47.0 / 2023-09-06

This release adds an experimental OpenTelemetry (OTLP) Ingestion feature,
and also new setting `keep_dropped_targets` to limit the amount of dropped
targets held in memory. This defaults to 0 meaning 'no limit', so we encourage
users with large Prometheus to try setting a limit such as 100.

## 2.43.0 / 2023-03-21

We are working on some performance improvements in Prometheus, which are only
built into Prometheus when compiling it using the Go tag `stringlabels`
(therefore they are not shipped in the default binaries). It uses a data
structure for labels that uses a single string to hold all the label/values,
resulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. We would like
to encourage users who are interested in these improvements to help us measure
the gains on their production architecture. We are providing release artefacts
`2.43.0+stringlabels` and Docker images tagged `v2.43.0-stringlabels` with those
improvements for testing. #10991

* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Correctly update `prometheus_tsdb_head_chunks_removed_total` and `prometheus_tsdb_head_chunks` metrics when reading WAL. #11858
* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Use the correct unit (seconds) when recording out-of-order append deltas in the `prometheus_tsdb_sample_ooo_delta` metric. #12004

## 2.42.0 / 2023-01-31

This release comes with a bunch of feature coverage for native histograms and breaking changes.

If you are trying native histograms already, we recommend you remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.
Because the old WAL record for native histograms is not backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data loss for the latest data.

Additionally, if you scrape "float histograms" or use recording rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float histograms),
it is a one-way street since older versions do not support float histograms.

## 2.40.0 / 2022-11-08

This release introduces an experimental, native way of representing and storing histograms.

It can be enabled in Prometheus via `--enable-feature=native-histograms` to accept native histograms.
Enabling native histograms will also switch the preferred exposition format to protobuf.

To instrument your application with native histograms, use the `main` branch of `client_golang` (this will change for the final release when v1.14.0 of client_golang will be out), and set the `NativeHistogramBucketFactor` in your `HistogramOpts` (`1.1` is a good starting point).
Your existing histograms won't switch to native histograms until `NativeHistogramBucketFactor` is set.

* [FEATURE] SD: Add service discovery for OVHcloud. #10802

* [ENHANCEMENT] Consul SD: Add enterprise admin partitions. Adds `__meta_consul_partition` label. Adds `partition` config in `consul_sd_config`. #11482
* [BUGFIX] API: Fix API error codes for `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/series`. #11356

## 2.35.0 / 2022-04-21

This Prometheus release is built with go1.18, which contains two noticeable changes related to TLS:

1. [TLS 1.0 and 1.1 disabled by default client-side](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#tls10).
Prometheus users can override this with the `min_version` parameter of [tls_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).
2. [Certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash function are rejected](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#sha1). This doesn't apply to self-signed root certificates.

## 2.7.0 / 2019-01-28

We're rolling back the Dockerfile changes introduced in 2.6.0. If you made changes to your docker deployment in 2.6.0, you will need to roll them back. This release also adds experimental support for disk size based retention. To accommodate that we are deprecating the flag `storage.tsdb.retention` in favour of `storage.tsdb.retention.time`. We print a warning if the flag is in use, but it will function without breaking until Prometheus 3.0.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved auto-completion in expression browser.
* [CHANGE] Kubernetes SD moves node label to instance label.

## 0.16.0 / 2015-10-09

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Release tarballs now contain the built binaries in a nested directory.
* The `hash_mod` relabeling action now uses MD5 hashes instead of FNV hashes to
  achieve a better distribution.
* The DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` was renamed to `__meta_dns_name`
  to reflect support for DNS record types other than `SRV`.
* The default full refresh interval for the file-based service discovery has been
  increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
* In relabeling, parts of a source label that weren't matched by
  the specified regular expression are no longer included in the replacement
  output.
* Queries no longer interpolate between two data points. Instead, the resulting
  value will always be the latest value before the evaluation query timestamp.
* Regular expressions supplied via the configuration are now anchored to match
  full strings instead of substrings.
* Global labels are not appended upon storing time series anymore. Instead,
  they are only appended when communicating with external systems
  (Alertmanager, remote storages, federation). They have thus also been renamed
  from `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* The names and units of metrics related to remote storage sample appends have
  been changed.
* The experimental support for writing to InfluxDB has been updated to work
  with InfluxDB 0.9.x. 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB are not supported anymore.
* Escape sequences in double- and single-quoted string literals in rules or query
  expressions are now interpreted like escape sequences in Go string literals
  (<https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals>).

Future breaking changes / deprecated features:

* The `delta()` function had an undocumented optional second boolean argument
  to make it behave like `increase()`. This second argument will be removed in
  the future. Migrate any occurrences of `delta(x, 1)` to use `increase(x)`
  instead.
* Support for filter operators between two scalar values (like `2 > 1`) will be
  removed in the future. These will require a `bool` modifier on the operator,
  e.g.  `2 > bool 1`.

All changes:

* [CHANGE] Renamed `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* [CHANGE] Vendoring is now done via govendor instead of godep.
* [CHANGE] Change web UI root page to show the graphing interface instead of
  the server status page.
* [CHANGE] Append global labels only when communicating with external systems
  instead of storing them locally.
* [CHANGE] Change all regexes in the configuration to do full-string matches
  instead of substring matches.
* [CHANGE] Remove interpolation of vector values in queries.
* [CHANGE] For alert `SUMMARY`/`DESCRIPTION` template fields, cast the alert
  value to `float64` to work with common templating functions.
* [CHANGE] In relabeling, don't include unmatched source label parts in the
  replacement.
* [CHANGE] Change default full refresh interval for the file-based service
  discovery from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
* [CHANGE] Rename the DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` to
  `__meta_dns_name` to reflect support for other record types than `SRV`.
* [CHANGE] Release tarballs now contain the binaries in a nested directory.

## 0.15.0 / 2015-07-21

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Relative paths for rule files are now evaluated relative to the config file.
* External reachability flags (`-web.*`) consolidated.
* The default storage directory has been changed from `/tmp/metrics`
  to `data` in the local directory.
* The `rule_checker` tool has been replaced by `promtool` with
  different flags and more functionality.
* Empty labels are now removed upon ingestion into the
  storage. Matching empty labels is now equivalent to matching unset
  labels (`mymetric{label=""}` now matches series that don't have
  `label` set at all).
* The special `__meta_consul_tags` label in Consul service discovery
  now starts and ends with tag separators to enable easier regex
  matching.
* The default scrape interval has been changed back from 1 minute to
  10 seconds.

  intensive.

  (rather than /tmp/metrics).

  Also fix a related but less severe bug in counting chunk descriptors.
