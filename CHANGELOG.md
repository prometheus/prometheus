## 2.7.0 / 2019-01-28

We're rolling back the Dockerfile changes introduced in 2.6.0. If you made changes to your docker deployment in 2.6.0, you will need to roll them back. This release also adds experimental support for disk size based retention. To accommodate that we are deprecating the flag `storage.tsdb.retention` in favour of `storage.tsdb.retention.time`. We print a warning if the flag is in use, but it will function without breaking until Prometheus 3.0.

## 0.16.0 / 2015-10-09

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Release tarballs now contain the built binaries in a nested directory.
* The `hash_mod` relabeling action now uses MD5 hashes instead of FNV hashes to
  achieve a better distribution.
* The DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` was renamed to `__meta_dns_name`
  to reflect support for DNS record types other than `SRV`.
* The default full refresh interval for the file-based service discovery has been
  increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
* In relabeling, parts of a source label that weren't matched by
  the specified regular expression are no longer included in the replacement
  output.
* Queries no longer interpolate between two data points. Instead, the resulting
  value will always be the latest value before the evaluation query timestamp.
* Regular expressions supplied via the configuration are now anchored to match
  full strings instead of substrings.
* Global labels are not appended upon storing time series anymore. Instead,
  they are only appended when communicating with external systems
  (Alertmanager, remote storages, federation). They have thus also been renamed
  from `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* The names and units of metrics related to remote storage sample appends have
  been changed.
* The experimental support for writing to InfluxDB has been updated to work
  with InfluxDB 0.9.x. 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB are not supported anymore.

  expressions are now interpreted like escape sequences in Go string literals
  (https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals).

Future breaking changes / deprecated features:

* The `delta()` function had an undocumented optional second boolean argument
  to make it behave like `increase()`. This second argument will be removed in
  the future. Migrate any occurrences of `delta(x, 1)` to use `increase(x)`
  instead.
* Support for filter operators between two scalar values (like `2 > 1`) will be
  removed in the future. These will require a `bool` modifier on the operator,
  e.g.  `2 > bool 1`.

All changes:

* [CHANGE] Renamed `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* [CHANGE] Vendoring is now done via govendor instead of godep.
* [CHANGE] Change web UI root page to show the graphing interface instead of
  the server status page.

  instead of storing them locally.

  instead of substring matches.

  replacement.

  discovery from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.

  binaries.

* [CHANGE] More efficient JSON result format in query API. This requires
  up-to-date versions of PromDash and prometheus_cli, too.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Excluded non-minified Bootstrap assets and the Bootstrap maps
  from embedding into the binary. Those files are only used for debugging,
  and then you can use -web.use-local-assets. By including fewer files, the
  RAM usage during compilation is much more manageable.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Help link points to https://prometheus.github.io now.
