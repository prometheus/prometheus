## 0.16.0 / 2015-10-09

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Release tarballs now contain the built binaries in a nested directory.
* The `hash_mod` relabeling action now uses MD5 hashes instead of FNV hashes to
  achieve a better distribution.
* The DNS-SD meta label `__meta_dns_srv_name` was renamed to `__meta_dns_name`
  to reflect support for DNS record types other than `SRV`.
* The default full refresh interval for the file-based service discovery has been
  increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
* In relabeling, parts of a source label that weren't matched by
  the specified regular expression are no longer included in the replacement
  output.
* Queries no longer interpolate between two data points. Instead, the resulting
  value will always be the latest value before the evaluation query timestamp.
* Regular expressions supplied via the configuration are now anchored to match
  full strings instead of substrings.
* Global labels are not appended upon storing time series anymore. Instead,
  they are only appended when communicating with external systems
  (Alertmanager, remote storages, federation). They have thus also been renamed
  from `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* The names and units of metrics related to remote storage sample appends have
  been changed.
* The experimental support for writing to InfluxDB has been updated to work
  with InfluxDB 0.9.x. 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB are not supported anymore.
* Escape sequences in double- and single-quoted string literals in rules or query
  expressions are now interpreted like escape sequences in Go string literals
  (https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals).

Future breaking changes / deprecated features:

* The `delta()` function had an undocumented optional second boolean argument
  to make it behave like `increase()`. This second argument will be removed in
  the future. Migrate any occurrences of `delta(x, 1)` to use `increase(x)`
  instead.
* Support for filter operators between two scalar values (like `2 > 1`) will be
  removed in the future. These will require a `bool` modifier on the operator,
  e.g.  `2 > bool 1`.

All changes:

* [CHANGE] Renamed `global.labels` to `global.external_labels`.
* [CHANGE] Vendoring is now done via govendor instead of godep.
* [CHANGE] Change web UI root page to show the graphing interface instead of
  the server status page.
* [CHANGE] Append global labels only when communicating with external systems
  instead of storing them locally.

  instead of substring matches.

  replacement.

  discovery from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.

## 0.10.0 / 2015-01-26
* [CHANGE] More efficient JSON result format in query API. This requires
  up-to-date versions of PromDash and prometheus_cli, too.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Excluded non-minified Bootstrap assets and the Bootstrap maps
  from embedding into the binary. Those files are only used for debugging,
  and then you can use -web.use-local-assets. By including fewer files, the
  RAM usage during compilation is much more manageable.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Help link points to http://prometheus.github.io now.
* [FEATURE] Consoles for haproxy and cloudwatch.
* [BUGFIX] Several fixes to graphs in consoles.
* [CLEANUP] Removed a file size check that did not check anything.

* [CHANGE] Reworked command line flags, now more consistent and taking into
  account needs of the new storage backend (see below).
* [CHANGE] Metric names are dropped after certain transformations.
* [CHANGE] Changed partitioning of summary metrics exported by Prometheus.
* [CHANGE] Got rid of Gerrit as a review tool.
* [CHANGE] 'Tabular' view now the default (rather than 'Graph') to avoid
  running very expensive queries accidentally.
* [CHANGE] On-disk format for stored samples changed. For upgrading, you have
  to nuke your old files completely. See "Complete rewrite of the storage
* [CHANGE] Removed 2nd argument from `delta`.
* [FEATURE] Added a `deriv` function.
* [FEATURE] Console templates.
* [FEATURE] Added `absent` function.
* [FEATURE] Allow omitting the metric name in queries.
* [BUGFIX] Removed all known race conditions.
* [BUGFIX] Metric mutations now handled correctly in all cases.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Proper double-start protection.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Complete rewrite of the storage layer. Benefits include:
  * Better query performance.
  * More samples in less RAM.
  * Better memory management.
  * Scales up to millions of time series and thousands of samples ingested
    per second.
  * Purging of obsolete samples much cleaner now, up to completely
    "forgetting" obsolete time series.
  * Proper instrumentation to diagnose the storage layer with... well...
    Prometheus.
  * Pure Go implementation, no need for cgo and shared C libraries anymore.
  * Better concurrency.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Copy-on-write semantics in the AST layer.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Switched from Go 1.3 to Go 1.4.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Vendored external dependencies with godeps.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Numerous Web UI improvements, moved to Bootstrap3 and
  Rickshaw 1.5.1.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved Docker integration.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Simplified the Makefile contraption.
* [CLEANUP] Put meta-data files into proper shape (LICENSE, README.md etc.)
* [CLEANUP] Removed all legitimate 'go vet' and 'golint' warnings.
* [CLEANUP] Removed dead code.

* [FEATURE] Let console templates get graph links from expressions.
* [FEATURE] Allow console templates to dynamically include other templates.
* [FEATURE] Template consoles now have access to their URL.
* [BUGFIX] Fixed time() function to return evaluation time, not wallclock time.
* [BUGFIX] Fixed HTTP connection leak when targets returned a non-200 status.
* [BUGFIX] Fixed link to console templates in UI.
* [PERFORMANCE] Removed extra memory copies while scraping targets.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Switched from Go 1.2.1 to Go 1.3.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Made metrics exported by Prometheus itself more consistent.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Removed incremental backoffs for unhealthy targets.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Dockerfile also builds Prometheus support tools now.

## 0.6.0 / 2014-06-30
* [FEATURE] Added console and alert templates support, along with various template functions.
* [PERFORMANCE] Much faster and more memory-efficient flushing to disk.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Query results are now only logged when debugging.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgraded to new Prometheus client library for exposing metrics.
* [BUGFIX] Samples are now kept in memory until fully flushed to disk.

* [BUGFIX] Fix for a deadlock race condition in the memory storage.
* [BUGFIX] Mac OS X build fixed.
* [BUGFIX] Built from Go 1.2.1, which has internal fixes to race conditions in garbage collection handling.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Internal storage interface refactoring that allows building e.g. the `rule_checker` tool without LevelDB dynamic library dependencies.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Cleanups around shutdown handling.
* [PERFORMANCE] Preparations for better memory reuse during marshalling / unmarshalling.
