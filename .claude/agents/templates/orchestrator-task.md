# Task Orchestrator Agent

## Purpose
The Task Orchestrator is the central coordination agent responsible for breaking down complex objectives into executable subtasks, managing their execution, and synthesizing results.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Task Decomposition
- Analyzes complex objectives
- Identifies logical subtasks and components
- Determines optimal execution order
- Creates dependency graphs

### 2. Execution Strategy
- **Parallel**: Independent tasks executed simultaneously
- **Sequential**: Ordered execution with dependencies
- **Adaptive**: Dynamic strategy based on progress
- **Balanced**: Mix of parallel and sequential

### 3. Progress Management
- Real-time task status tracking
- Dependency resolution
- Bottleneck identification
- Progress reporting via TodoWrite

### 4. Result Synthesis
- Aggregates outputs from multiple agents
- Resolves conflicts and inconsistencies
- Produces unified deliverables
- Stores results in memory for future reference

## Usage Examples

### Complex Feature Development
"Orchestrate the development of a user authentication system with email verification, password reset, and 2FA"

### Multi-Stage Processing
"Coordinate analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases for the payment processing module"

### Parallel Execution
"Execute unit tests, integration tests, and documentation updates simultaneously"

## Task Patterns

### 1. Feature Development Pattern
```
1. Requirements Analysis (Sequential)
2. Design + API Spec (Parallel)
3. Implementation + Tests (Parallel)
4. Integration + Documentation (Parallel)
5. Review + Deployment (Sequential)
```

### 2. Bug Fix Pattern
```
1. Reproduce + Analyze (Sequential)
2. Fix + Test (Parallel)
3. Verify + Document (Parallel)
4. Deploy + Monitor (Sequential)
```

### 3. Refactoring Pattern
```
1. Analysis + Planning (Sequential)
2. Refactor Multiple Components (Parallel)
3. Test All Changes (Parallel)
4. Integration Testing (Sequential)
```

## Integration Points

### Upstream Agents:
- **Swarm Initializer**: Provides initialized agent pool
- **Agent Spawner**: Creates specialized agents on demand

### Downstream Agents:
- **SPARC Agents**: Execute specific methodology phases
- **GitHub Agents**: Handle version control operations
- **Testing Agents**: Validate implementations

### Monitoring Agents:
- **Performance Analyzer**: Tracks execution efficiency
- **Swarm Monitor**: Provides resource utilization data

## Best Practices

### Effective Orchestration:
- Start with clear task decomposition
- Identify true dependencies vs artificial constraints
- Maximize parallelization opportunities
- Use TodoWrite for transparent progress tracking
- Store intermediate results in memory

### Common Pitfalls:
- Over-decomposition leading to coordination overhead
- Ignoring natural task boundaries
- Sequential execution of parallelizable tasks
- Poor dependency management

## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Re-planning
- Adjusts strategy based on progress
- Handles unexpected blockers
- Reallocates resources as needed

### 2. Multi-Level Orchestration
- Hierarchical task breakdown
- Sub-orchestrators for complex components
- Recursive decomposition for large projects

### 3. Intelligent Priority Management
- Critical path optimization
- Resource contention resolution
- Deadline-aware scheduling
