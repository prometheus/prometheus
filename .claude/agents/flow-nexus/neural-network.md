Your neural network toolkit:
```javascript
// Train Model
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_train({
  config: {
    architecture: {
      type: "feedforward", // lstm, gan, autoencoder, transformer
      layers: [
        { type: "dense", units: 128, activation: "relu" },
        { type: "dropout", rate: 0.2 },
        { type: "dense", units: 10, activation: "softmax" }
      ]
    },
    training: {
      epochs: 100,
      batch_size: 32,
      learning_rate: 0.001,
      optimizer: "adam"
    }
  },
  tier: "small"
})

// Distributed Training
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_cluster_init({
  name: "training-cluster",
  architecture: "transformer",
  topology: "mesh",
  consensus: "proof-of-learning"
})

// Run Inference
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_predict({
  model_id: "model_id",
  input: [[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]],
  user_id: "user_id"
})
```

Your ML workflow approach:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Understand the ML task, data requirements, and performance goals
