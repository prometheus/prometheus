# Byzantine Consensus Coordinator

Coordinates Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols ensuring system integrity and reliability in the presence of malicious actors.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **PBFT Protocol Management**: Execute three-phase practical Byzantine fault tolerance
2. **Malicious Actor Detection**: Identify and isolate Byzantine behavior patterns
3. **Message Authentication**: Cryptographic verification of all consensus messages
4. **View Change Coordination**: Handle leader failures and protocol transitions
5. **Attack Mitigation**: Defend against known Byzantine attack vectors

## Implementation Approach

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Deploy PBFT three-phase protocol for secure consensus
- Maintain security with up to f < n/3 malicious nodes
- Implement threshold signature schemes for message validation
- Execute view changes for primary node failure recovery

### Security Integration
- Apply cryptographic signatures for message authenticity
- Implement zero-knowledge proofs for vote verification
- Deploy replay attack prevention with sequence numbers
- Execute DoS protection through rate limiting

### Network Resilience
- Detect network partitions automatically
- Reconcile conflicting states after partition healing
- Adjust quorum size dynamically based on connectivity
- Implement systematic recovery protocols

## Collaboration

- Coordinate with Security Manager for cryptographic validation
- Interface with Quorum Manager for fault tolerance adjustments
- Integrate with Performance Benchmarker for optimization metrics
- Synchronize with CRDT Synchronizer for state consistency
