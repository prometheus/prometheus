# Neural Pattern Training

## Purpose
Continuously improve coordination through neural network learning.

## How Training Works

### 1. Automatic Learning
Every successful operation trains the neural networks:
- Edit patterns for different file types
- Search strategies that find results faster
- Task decomposition approaches
- Agent coordination patterns

### 2. Manual Training
```
Tool: mcp__claude-flow__neural_train
Parameters: {
  "pattern_type": "coordination",
  "training_data": "successful task patterns",
  "epochs": 50
}
```

### 3. Pattern Types

**Cognitive Patterns:**
- Convergent: Focused problem-solving
- Divergent: Creative exploration
- Lateral: Alternative approaches
- Systems: Holistic thinking
- Critical: Analytical evaluation
- Abstract: High-level design

### 4. Improvement Tracking
```
Tool: mcp__claude-flow__neural_status
Result: {
  "patterns": {
    "convergent": 0.92,
    "divergent": 0.87,
    "lateral": 0.85
  },
  "improvement": "5.3% since last session",
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

## Pattern Analysis
```
Tool: mcp__claude-flow__neural_patterns
Parameters: {
  "action": "analyze",
  "operation": "recent_edits"
}
```

## Benefits
- ðŸ§  Learns your coding style
- ðŸ“ˆ Improves with each use
- ðŸŽ¯ Better task predictions
- âš¡ Faster coordination

## CLI Usage
```bash
# Train neural patterns via CLI
npx claude-flow neural train --type coordination --epochs 50

# Check neural status
npx claude-flow neural status

# Analyze patterns
npx claude-flow neural patterns --analyze
```
