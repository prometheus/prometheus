# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/bwplotka/flagarize/releases/tag/v0.9.0) - 2020.03.22

Initial release 💪💪 💪

Why 0.9.0? Well, because we plan to release 1.0 once we introduce this library to [Thanos](http://github.com/thanos-io/thanos) as the final test (:
