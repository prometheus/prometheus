# govmomi

A Go library for interacting with VMware vSphere APIs (ESXi and/or vCenter).

In addition to the vSphere API client, this repository includes:

* [govc](./govc) - vSphere CLI

* [vcsim](./vcsim) - vSphere API mock framework

* [toolbox](./toolbox) - VM guest tools framework

## Compatibility

This library is built for and tested against ESXi and vCenter 6.0 and 6.5.

It should work with versions 5.5 and 5.1, but neither are officially supported.

## Documentation

The APIs exposed by this library very closely follow the API described in the [VMware vSphere API Reference Documentation][apiref].
Refer to this document to become familiar with the upstream API.

The code in the `govmomi` package is a wrapper for the code that is generated from the vSphere API description.
It primarily provides convenience functions for working with the vSphere API.
See [godoc.org][godoc] for documentation.
