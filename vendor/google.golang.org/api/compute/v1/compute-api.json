For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, \u003e, or \u003c.\n\nFor example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.\n\nYou can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.\n\nTo filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by the nextHop field of the winning route - either to another instance destination, an instance gateway, or a Google Compute Engine-operated gateway.\n\nPackets that do not match any route in the sending instance's routing table are dropped.
