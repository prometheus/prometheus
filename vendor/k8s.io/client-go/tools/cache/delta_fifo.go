// NewDeltaFIFO returns a Queue which can be used to process changes to items.
//
// keyFunc is used to figure out what key an object should have. (It is
// exposed in the returned DeltaFIFO's KeyOf() method, with additional handling
// around deleted objects and queue state).
//
// 'knownObjects' may be supplied to modify the behavior of Delete,
// Replace, and Resync.  It may be nil if you do not need those
// modifications.
//
// TODO: consider merging keyLister with this object, tracking a list of
//       "known" keys when Pop() is called. Have to think about how that
//       affects error retrying.
// NOTE: It is possible to misuse this and cause a race when using an
//       external known object source.
//       Whether there is a potential race depends on how the consumer
//       modifies knownObjects. In Pop(), process function is called under
//       lock, so it is safe to update data structures in it that need to be
//       in sync with the queue (e.g. knownObjects).
//
//       Example:
//       In case of sharedIndexInformer being a consumer
//       (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0cdd940f/staging/
//       src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache/shared_informer.go#L192),
//       there is no race as knownObjects (s.indexer) is modified safely
//       under DeltaFIFO's lock. The only exceptions are GetStore() and
//       GetIndexer() methods, which expose ways to modify the underlying
//       storage. Currently these two methods are used for creating Lister
//       and internal tests.
//
// Also see the comment on DeltaFIFO.
//
// Warning: This constructs a DeltaFIFO that does not differentiate between
// events caused by a call to Replace (e.g., from a relist, which may
// contain object updates), and synthetic events caused by a periodic resync
// (which just emit the existing object). See https://issue.k8s.io/86015 for details.

// DeltaFIFO is like FIFO, but differs in two ways.  One is that the
// accumulator associated with a given object's key is not that object
// but rather a Deltas, which is a slice of Delta values for that
// object.  Applying an object to a Deltas means to append a Delta
// except when the potentially appended Delta is a Deleted and the
// Deltas already ends with a Deleted.  In that case the Deltas does
// not grow, although the terminal Deleted will be replaced by the new
// Deleted if the older Deleted's object is a
// DeletedFinalStateUnknown.
//
// The other difference is that DeltaFIFO has an additional way that
// an object can be applied to an accumulator, called Sync.
//
// DeltaFIFO is a producer-consumer queue, where a Reflector is
// intended to be the producer, and the consumer is whatever calls
// the Pop() method.
//
// DeltaFIFO solves this use case:
//  * You want to process every object change (delta) at most once.
//  * When you process an object, you want to see everything
//    that's happened to it since you last processed it.
//  * You want to process the deletion of some of the objects.
//  * You might want to periodically reprocess objects.
//
// DeltaFIFO's Pop(), Get(), and GetByKey() methods return
// interface{} to satisfy the Store/Queue interfaces, but they
// will always return an object of type Deltas. List() returns
// the newest objects currently in the FIFO.
//
// A DeltaFIFO's knownObjects KeyListerGetter provides the abilities
// to list Store keys and to get objects by Store key.  The objects in
// question are called "known objects" and this set of objects
// modifies the behavior of the Delete, Replace, and Resync methods
// (each in a different way).
