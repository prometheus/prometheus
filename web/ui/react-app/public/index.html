      The GLOBAL_PATH_PREFIX placeholder magic value is replaced during serving by Prometheus
      and set to Prometheus's external URL path. It gets prepended to all links back
      to Prometheus, both for asset loading as well as API accesses.

      The GLOBAL_CONSOLES_LINK placeholder magic value is replaced during serving by Prometheus
      and set to the consoles link if it exists. It will render a "Consoles" link in the navbar when
      it is non-empty.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
