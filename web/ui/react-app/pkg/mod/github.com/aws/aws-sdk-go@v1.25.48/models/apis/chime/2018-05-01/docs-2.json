This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. It also includes some server-side API actions to use with the Amazon Chime SDK. For more information about the Amazon Chime SDK, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html\">Using the Amazon Chime SDK</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.</p> <dl> <dt>Using an AWS SDK</dt> <dd> <p>You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication.
