// Package globalaccelerator provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Global Accelerator.
//
// This is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data
// types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features,
// see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html).
//
// AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service in which you create accelerators
// to improve availability and performance for internet applications used by
// a global audience.
//
// You must specify the US-West-2 (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.
//
// Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate
// with your accelerator. These IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network
// and distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources
// in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications.
// Endpoints can be Elastic IP addresses, Network Load Balancers, and Application
// Load Balancers that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions.
//
// Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal
// regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you
// configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration
// to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy
// endpoints.
//
// Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve
// performance and availability for your applications:
//
// Static IP address
//
// AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses which
// are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single fixed entry
// points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing or Elastic
// IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those
// to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to be accessed by a Global Accelerator
// static IP address.
//
// Accelerator
//
// An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network
// to improve availability and performance for your internet applications that
// have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.
//
// Network zone
//
// A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from
// a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is
// an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure
// an accelerator, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If
// one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address
// blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client
// applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated
// network zone.
//
// Listener
//
// A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator,
// based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each listener has one
// or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints
// in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying
// the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed
// to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.
//
// Endpoint group
//
// Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups
// include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the
// percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group
// by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily
// do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases
// across different AWS Regions, for example.
//
// Endpoint
//
// An endpoint is an Elastic IP address, Network Load Balancer, or Application
// Load Balancer. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on several factors, including
// the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and the configuration
// options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you
// can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the
// proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example,
// to do performance testing within a Region.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Global Accelerator with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
