// Package ebs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Elastic Block Store.
//
// You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to directly
// read the data on your EBS snapshots, and identify the difference between
// two snapshots. You can view the details of blocks in an EBS snapshot, compare
// the block difference between two snapshots, and directly access the data
// in a snapshot. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers
// backup services for EBS, the EBS direct APIs makes it easier and more cost-effective
// to track incremental changes on your EBS volumes via EBS snapshots. This
// can be done without having to create new volumes from EBS snapshots, and
// then use EC2 instances to compare the differences.
//
// This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data
// types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information
// about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how
// to use them effectively, see Accessing the Contents of an EBS Snapshot (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html).
// For more information about how to use the EBS direct APIs, see the EBS direct
// APIs User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshots.html).
// To view the currently supported AWS Regions and endpoints for the EBS direct
// APIs, see AWS Service Endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ebs_region)
// in the AWS General Reference.

// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ebs-2019-11-02 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Elastic Block Store with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
