  "service": "<fullname>AWS CodeBuild</fullname> <p>AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i> </p> <p>AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchDeleteBuilds</code>: Deletes one or more builds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>BatchGetBuilds</code>: Gets information about one or more builds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>BatchGetProjects</code>: Gets information about one or more build projects. A <i>build project</i> defines how AWS CodeBuild runs a build. This includes information such as where to get the source code to build, the build environment to use, the build commands to run, and where to store the build output. A <i>build environment</i> is a representation of operating system, programming language runtime, and tools that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can add tags to build projects to help manage your resources and costs.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>BatchGetReportGroups</code>: Returns an array of report groups. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>BatchGetReports</code>: Returns an array of reports. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateProject</code>: Creates a build project.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateReportGroup</code>: Creates a report group.
