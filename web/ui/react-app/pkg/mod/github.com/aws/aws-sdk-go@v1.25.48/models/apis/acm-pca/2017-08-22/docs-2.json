The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.</p>",

    "CreatePermission": "<p>Assigns permissions from a private CA to a designated AWS service. Services are specified by their service principals and can be given permission to create and retrieve certificates on a private CA. Services can also be given permission to list the active permissions that the private CA has granted. For ACM to automatically renew your private CA's certificates, you must assign all possible permissions from the CA to the ACM service principal.</p> <p>At this time, you can only assign permissions to ACM (<code>acm.amazonaws.com</code>).

To do this, call the <a>UpdateCertificateAuthority</a> action and set the <b>CertificateAuthorityStatus</b> parameter to <code>DISABLED</code>. </p> <p>Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is <code>CREATING</code>). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is <code>PENDING_CERTIFICATE</code>). </p> <p>When you successfully call <a>DeleteCertificateAuthority</a>, the CA's status changes to <code>DELETED</code>. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the <code>PermanentDeletionTimeInDays</code> parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days.

    "RevokeCertificate": "<p>Revokes a certificate that was issued inside ACM Private CA.
