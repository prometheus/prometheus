      Placeholders replaced by Prometheus during serving:
      - CONSOLES_LINK_PLACEHOLDER is replaced and set to the consoles link if it exists.
        It will render a "Consoles" link in the navbar when it is non-empty.
      - AGENT_MODE_PLACEHOLDER is replaced by a boolean indicating if Prometheus is running in agent mode.
        It true, it will disable querying capacities in the UI and generally adapt the UI to the agent mode.
        It has to be represented as a string, because booleans can be mangled to !1 in production builds.
      - READY_PLACEHOLDER is replaced by a boolean indicating whether Prometheus was ready at the time the
        web app was served. It has to be represented as a string, because booleans can be mangled to !1 in
        production builds.
      - LOOKBACKDELTA_PLACEHOLDER is replaced by the default lookback delta duration used for queries.

        The TITLE_PLACEHOLDER magic value is replaced during serving by Prometheus.
        We need it dynamic because it can be overridden by the command line flag `web.page-title`.
