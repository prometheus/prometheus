## Option 2: Detailed Technical Update

```markdown
Hello Prometheus community!

I'm excited to share that I've implemented the rule test coverage feature requested in this issue. PR #17251 is now available for review.

## Implementation Details

### Features Implemented
1. **Coverage Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking for both alert and recording rules
2. **Output Formats**:
   - Text (human-readable)
   - JSON (for programmatic processing)
   - JUnit XML (for CI integration)
3. **Threshold Enforcement**: `--min-coverage` flag for CI/CD pipelines
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Tracks indirect coverage through recording rule dependencies
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Multiple flags for customization

### Example Usage
```bash
# Basic coverage report
promtool test rules --coverage rules.yml

# JSON output with threshold
promtool test rules --coverage --coverage-output-format=json --min-coverage=80 rules.yml

# CI/CD integration with JUnit XML
promtool test rules --coverage --coverage-output-format=junit --coverage-output-file=coverage.xml rules.yml
```

### Technical Approach
- Non-breaking changes to existing functionality
- Modular design for easy extension
- Comprehensive test coverage (ironically! 😄)
- Documentation included

The implementation addresses all requirements mentioned in the original issue and adds several enhancements based on common CI/CD patterns.

Would love to get feedback from the maintainers and community. Happy to make any adjustments needed.

Thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to this discussion!
