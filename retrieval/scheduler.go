// first.  Depending on the retrieval interval and number of consecutive
// unhealthy markings, the query of these unhealthy individuals may come before
// the healthy ones for a short time to help ensure expeditious retrieval.
// The inflection point that drops these to the back of the queue is beneficial
// to save resources in the long-run.
//
// If a subject is healthy, its next scheduling opportunity is set to
// earliest, for this ensures fair querying of all remaining healthy targets and
// removes bias in the ordering.  In order for the anti-bias value to have any
// value, the earliest opportunity should be set to a value that is constant
// for a given batch of subjects who are to be scraped on a given interval.
